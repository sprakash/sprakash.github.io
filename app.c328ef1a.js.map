The viewer has the opportunity to audition 5 actresses for the same role of Kaos, sidekick to the superhero in the superhero movie “Bang &amp; Kaos”. The viewer is a casting director and decides who gets called back. The theme was diversity in casting. I picked actresses of different ethnicities and using Interlude’s (now acquired by eKo) platform created an experience where the user can make a decision to cast the role. Through this work I addressed my own challenges as an actor in the audition room as a person of color.  I developed the concept, served as director, editor and producer.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</section>\r\n\t</section>\r\n</template>\r\n<script>\r\n\timport Navigation from './Navigation'\r\n\texport default {\r\n\t\tname: 'Digital',\r\n\t\tcomponents: {\r\n\t\t\tNavigation,\r\n        },\r\n\t\tcreated() {\r\n            this.msg = this.$route.params.isSlideshow;\r\n        },\r\n\t\tdata() {\r\n\t\t\treturn {\r\n\t\t\t\tmsg: 'Welcome to the Digital / Intersect section'\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n</script>\r\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\r\n#app {\r\n\twidth: 100%;\r\n}\r\n\r\nheader {\r\n\ta {\r\n\t\tcolor: inherit;\r\n\t\ttext-decoration: none;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n.slicinItup {\r\n\tpadding-top: 0em;\r\n}\r\n\t\r\na {\r\n\r\n\tfont-size: 1em;\r\n\tfont-weight: bolder;\r\n}\r\n\r\nhr {\r\n\tmargin-bottom: 2em;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh2 {\r\n\tfont-size: 1.25em;\r\n\tcolor: #500606;\r\n\ttext-transform: capitalize;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh3 {\r\n\tcolor: #f36464;\r\n    text-transform: capitalize;\r\n    margin: 0;\r\n    padding: .5em 0;\r\n    font-size: 1.75em;\r\n    background-color: black;\r\n    font-family: \"Cambria\";\r\n    line-height: 1.25em;\r\n\r\n\tspan {\r\n\t\tcolor: white;\r\n\t    text-transform: lowercase;\r\n\t    font-size: .75em;\r\n\t    display: block;\r\n\t    line-height: 1.75em;\r\n\t    border-top: 1px solid white;\r\n    \tmargin: 1em 0 0;\r\n    \tpadding: 1em 0 0;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\ta {\r\n\t\ttext-transform : lowercase;\r\n\t\ttext-decoration: none;\r\n\t\tcolor: #72ff00c7;\r\n\t\tdisplay: none;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t&:hover {\r\n\t\tcursor: pointer;

Just For Myself is a not-for-profit organization that educates children of construction workes and house help, helps them get placed in schools and provides for basic nutrition and counseling.  The organization is based in Gurgaon, Haryana. The founder Mrs. Ranjana Joshi entrusted me with writing a play based on the story of how her organization came to be. The play includes music and movement. I wrote the piece and rehearsed with the children in a park of their community for several weekends to present a stage show. They were coached in performance on stage, voice work and scene improvisation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"collab\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Code</h2>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"collab-content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"collab-images\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/assets/fake/halApplogo.jpg\"/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tServing as a web developer for Rattapallax's project Hal &amp; Minter. Hal Horowitz is a poet who has had Parkinson's disease over twenty years during this time he has continued to remain a poet.
